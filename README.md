steppr.io is a a trio of sixteen-step music sequencers designed for real-time interaction and music creation. The trio is made up of a lead synthesizer, a bass synth, and a drum machine, which allow for live note entry by clicking on a step while the sequencers are running. Each player is given the option to change sounds on the fly, as well as a fader for level control. Any of these changes will be seen and heard by the other player, and making music together becomes very immediate.
